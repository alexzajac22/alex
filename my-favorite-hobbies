    My favorite hobbies are photography and riding my motercycle. I started doing photography profesionaly about a year ago. I have a nice sony mirrorless camera, and a mavic 2 pro drone. Every once in a while I enjoy goingn out and taking photos. After I get a few clean shots I take my gear home and I hook the sd card in and stert editing my photos. I feel like taking the photos is great, but the way you edit the photo helps tell the story.

    The other thing that I enjoy doing is riding my motercycle. I spend alot of time at work driving a truck so the standard two wheel drive is not something that excited me as much anymore, so I went out and bought a Yamaha R7 which was a great choice. Its nice to go out on rides when feeling stress and sometimes I go out with my camera to find places to take photos.
